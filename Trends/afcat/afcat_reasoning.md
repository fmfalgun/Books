**Q13.** Which figure completes the pattern?
```
Pattern: △ ▢ △ ▢ △ ?
Options:
A) ▢
B) △
C) ◯
D) ▢△
```

**Answer:** A | **Explanation:** Alternating pattern of triangle and square; next should be square

**Q14.** What comes next in the sequence?

C) ⭐
D) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

**Answer:** A | **Explanation:** Number of stars increases by 1 each time (1, 2, 3, 4)

### Type 2: Spatial Visualization (3D Objects - Cubes)

**Q15.** When a cube is unfolded, which of the following nets is INCORRECT for a standard cube?
```
A cube has 6 faces. When unfolded correctly, opposite faces should not be adjacent.
Options shown as nets (letter arrangements representing unfolded cube)
```

**Note:** Without visual representation, assume standard cube net rules apply.

**Answer:** Typically, a net with opposite faces adjacent is incorrect (For a cube: if one face is marked 1, opposite should be 6 and not adjacent in the net)

### Type 3: Figure Analogy (Visual Relationship)

**Q16.** Figure analogy - If Figure A is to Figure B as Figure C is to ?
```
A) [circle filled] is to [circle outlined] as [square filled] is to ?
B) [square outlined]
C) [square filled with pattern]
D) [square half-filled]
```

**Answer:** B | **Explanation:** The relationship is from filled to outlined; same applies to square

### Type 4: Matrix Puzzles (3x3 Patterns)

**Q17.** What number replaces the question mark in the 3x3 matrix?
```
2  4  6
3  6  9
4  ?  12
```

**Answer:** 8 | **Explanation:** Each row follows pattern: first number × 1, × 2, × 3. Row 3: 4×1=4, 4×2=8, 4×3=12

**Q18.** Complete the 3x3 pattern:
```
A  B  C
D  E  F
G  H  ?
```

**Answer:** I | **Explanation:** Alphabetical sequence continues; the next letter after H is I

### Type 5: Mirror & Water Image

**Q19.** If a word is written as shown and then reflected in a mirror, what would be its mirror image?
```
Example: HELLO in mirror would appear reversed
```

**For word "RADAR":**
A) RADAR (reads same)
B) RADAE
C) ADAR reversed
D) Cannot determine

**Answer:** A | **Explanation:** RADAR is a palindrome; it reads the same forwards and backwards, so mirror image is identical

### Type 6: Logical Sequence (Visual Series)

**Q20.** What is the next figure in the sequence?
```
Sequence: ◯ ◯◯ ◯◯◯ ◯◯◯◯ ?
Pattern: Circles increase by 1
Options:
A) ◯◯◯◯◯ (5 circles)
B) ◯ (1 circle)
C) ◯◯ (2 circles)
D) ◯◯◯ (3 circles)
```

**Answer:** A | **Explanation:** Progressive increase: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 circles

### Type 7: Counting Figures (Embedded Objects)

**Q21.** How many triangles are in the following figure?
```
Imagine a large triangle with internal lines creating smaller triangles
(In a typical triangle divided by lines, count all possible triangles)
```

**Typical Answer:** For a triangle subdivided into 4 smaller triangles, the count is 1 (large) + 4 (individual) = 5 or more depending on configuration

### Type 8: Direction & Distance Reasoning

**Q22.** A person starts from point A and walks 5 km north, then 3 km east, then 5 km south, then 2 km west. How far is the person from the starting point A?
A) 1 km
B) 2 km
C) 3 km
D) 4 km

**Answer:** A | **Explanation:** 
- Net North displacement: 5 - 5 = 0 km
- Net East displacement: 3 - 2 = 1 km
- Distance from start = √(0² + 1²) = 1 km
