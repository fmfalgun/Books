# The Evolution of Modern AI: A Research Roadmap (2017–2025)

## Phase I: The Foundational Era (2017–2021)
*The era of "Scale" and the birth of the Transformer.*

*   **2017 (June):** Google Brain researchers publish **"Attention Is All You Need"**, introducing the Transformer architecture. This is the "Patient Zero" for all modern LLMs.
*   **2018 (Oct):** Google releases **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), revolutionizing NLP with pre-training/fine-tuning paradigms.
*   **2020 (May):** OpenAI releases **GPT-3** paper ("Language Models are Few-Shot Learners").
    *   *Key Research:* Proved that massive scale (175B parameters) enables "emergent behaviors" like coding and translation without explicit training.
*   **2020 (Dec):** DeepMind releases **AlphaFold 2** at CASP14, solving the 50-year-old "protein folding problem" using AI.
*   **2021 (Jan):** OpenAI releases **DALL-E** (text-to-image) and **CLIP** (connecting text and images), laying the groundwork for multimodal AI.

## Phase II: The Generative Explosion (2022–2023)
*From research labs to public ubiquity.*

*   **2022 (April):** Google releases **PaLM** (Pathways Language Model), demonstrating advanced reasoning capabilities at 540B parameters.
*   **2022 (Aug):** Stability AI releases **Stable Diffusion**, an open-source text-to-image model that democratizes generative art.
*   **2022 (Nov 30):** **ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5)** is released to the public.
    *   *Impact:* The "iPhone moment" for AI; 100M users in 2 months.
*   **2023 (Feb):** Google announces **Bard** (later Gemini) in response to ChatGPT.
*   **2023 (Feb):** Meta releases **LLaMA** (Large Language Model Meta AI) to researchers.
    *   *Key Research:* Proved that smaller, better-trained models (Chinchilla scaling laws) can outperform larger ones.
*   **2023 (March):** OpenAI releases **GPT-4**.
    *   *Capability Jump:* Multimodal (vision input), passing the Bar Exam (90th percentile), and massive reasoning improvements.
*   **2023 (March):** Anthropic releases **Claude 1**, founded by former OpenAI VP of Research Dario Amodei, focusing on "Constitutional AI" and safety.
*   **2023 (Dec):** Google releases **Gemini 1.0**, the first natively multimodal model.

## Phase III: The Era of Reasoning & Efficiency (2024)
*Context windows, open weights, and the rise of "System 2" thinking.*

*   **2024 (Feb):** Google releases **Gemini 1.5 Pro** with a **1 million token context window**, effectively "solving" needle-in-a-haystack retrieval.
*   **2024 (March):** Anthropic releases **Claude 3** family (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus).
    *   *Milestone:* Claude 3 Opus surpasses GPT-4 on many benchmarks for the first time.
*   **2024 (April):** Meta releases **Llama 3** (8B and 70B), setting a new standard for open-weights performance.
*   **2024 (June):** **DeepSeek-V2** and **DeepSeek-Coder-V2** (China) are released.
    *   *Significance:* Breaks the dominance of US closed models in coding tasks, introducing efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures at a fraction of the cost.
*   **2024 (Sept/Oct):** OpenAI releases **o1 ("Strawberry")** preview.
    *   *Paradigm Shift:* Introduces **"Test-Time Compute"**—models that "think" (chain-of-thought) before answering, excelling at PhD-level math and science.
*   **2024 (Dec):** **DeepSeek-V3** is released, matching top-tier US models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5) in general benchmarks.

## Phase IV: The Agentic Frontier (2025 & Beyond)
*Reasoning deployed to the physical and digital world.*

*   **2025 (Jan):** **DeepSeek-R1** released.
    *   *Key Trend:* Open-source reasoning models that rival OpenAI's o1, available to the public. Dubbed the "Watson for doctors" in medical applications.
*   **2025 (Jan):** Alibaba releases **Qwen 2.5 Max**, cementing China's leadership in the open-model ecosystem.
*   **2025 (Feb):** Introduction of **"Thinking Retrievers" (O1 Embedder)**.
    *   *Research Shift:* Moving beyond simple RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to systems that "reason" about *what* to search for before acting.
*   **2025 (Mid-Year):** **Goedel-Prover-V2** sets new standards in automated theorem proving.
    *   *Impact:* AI begins to autonomously verify software code and mathematical proofs at scale.
