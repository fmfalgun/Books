Exercise 2.26: Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal, explain why.
	(a) const int buf; 
	(b) int cnt = 0;
	(c) const int sz = cnt; 
	(d) ++cnt; ++sz;

My Answer: 
	a) legal
	b) legal
	c) illegal, const can be asign to variable's value it must be proper int value
	d) first is legal, but if sz in const then it is illegal coz they can't be increase

	| Statement             | Legal? | Explanation                             |
	| --------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
	| `const int buf;`      | ❌      | const must be initialized               |
	| `int cnt = 0;`        | ✅      | normal initialization                   |
	| `const int sz = cnt;` | ✅      | const can be initialized from non-const |
	| `++cnt;`              | ✅      | cnt is modifiable                       |
	| `++sz;`               | ❌      | sz is const                             |
