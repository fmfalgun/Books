Exercise 2.22: Assuming p is a pointer to int, explain the following code:
if (p) // ...
if (*p) // ...

my answer: 
	1st condition - true if p is not nullptr
	2nd condition - true if p is not referenced to variable with 0 as stored value.

gpt answer: 
	| Expression | Checks           | Meaning              |
	| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
	| `if (p)`   | Pointer value    | Is `p` non-null?     |
	| `if (*p)`  | Pointed-to value | Is the int non-zero? |
